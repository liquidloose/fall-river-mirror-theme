/**
 * Paragraph Block Variation Bound to Article Journalist Bio
 * 
 * This file registers a custom variation for the core/paragraph block that is
 * pre-configured with a block binding to display the short bio of the first
 * journalist associated with an article.
 * 
 * When a user inserts this variation, the paragraph will automatically display
 * the journalist's short bio for the current article.
 * The binding uses the 'fr-mirror/article-meta' source with the key
 * 'short_bio', which retrieves the bio_short from the first journalist.
 * 
 * This variation is useful in article templates and patterns where you want to
 * display the journalist's bio without manually configuring the binding each time.
 * 
 * @package FallRiverMirror
 * @since 1.0.0
 * 
 * @see https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-variations/
 * @see fr_mirror_get_article_meta_binding() for the binding callback
